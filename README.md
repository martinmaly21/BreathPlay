# BreathPlay

BreathPlay is an attempt to gamify breathwork.

Breathwork has been clinically proven to boast an array of both physical and mental health benefits. Despite this, many people still see it as a rather dull activity. The goal of this experience was to change that perception. In BreathPlay, your microphone detects your breathing which allows you control an object moving down a path. Inhale and exhale to move the object from side to side to avoid obstacles.
